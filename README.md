# DrawingRobot
Making a Lynxmotion AL5D robotic arm draw what it sees using a webcam, OpenCV, and MATLAB.

Image processing is performed in C++ using OpenCV functions. This code is then compiled into a .mex file that will be called from MATLAB.
MATLAB uses the mex function generated by findPaths.cpp to obtain path data about the source image. This path data is then used to
generate movement commands for the AL5D arm, which will then draw a copy of the source image. 

<b>Usage:</b>

Prereqs: USB webcam , AL5D arm connected to PC. 

From MATLAB command line:
  
  init             opens a serial connection to the robot
  
  drawPaths(Rob)   grabs a frame from the webcam and attempts to draw a copy
  


This project has been tested using Visual Studio 2013 and MATLAB r2014b. Visual Studio will need to be set up to use OpenCV libraries and
able to build a project with a .mex target. This is a work in progress: comments and constructive criticism are welcome!
